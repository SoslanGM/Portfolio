                    <h3>Education:</h3>
                    - 2005-2009, grades 8 through 11, IT Lyceum, programming
                    <br>- 2009-2011, Bauman's Moscow State Technical University, programming.
                    <br>Sadly, I couldn't complete education there due to complications in my family.<br>
                    
                    <br>Next few years I spend on various data entry and simple helpdesk jobs,
                    <br> utilizing my general knowledge of computers, unconfident that my programming skills could pay off.

                    - Sep 2015 - Jan 2016 <b>Gameboloid</b>, "Woodland Quest" match-3 game<br>
                    After a couple weeks of studying Unity game engine, and completing a test project(snake game in 3d),<br>
                    I entered a small dev team led by a friend back from my university days, that luckly had a junior programmer opening.<br>
                    Sadly, the dream didn't last forever as the company that owned the team was forced to have massive layoffs.<br>
                    During my time there I've:
                    <br>- integrated an ads library Appodeal into the game codebase and processed some events it couldn't at the time
                    <br>- added some of the interface features, like popping text lines upon combos and timers
                    <br>- did some of the character animations

                <p>
                    Nearing the end of my time at post office I decided it's time to gave another crack at programming
                    <br> and started learning Python and SQL. Here's my <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/profile/soslangm">DataCamp profile</a>.<br>
                    <br> Below are some of the projects I've completed to test and hone my newfound skills.
